KMRL LESSONS LEARNED – CONSOLIDATED FEEDBACK

1. Communication Between Departments
Staff shared that coordination between operations, maintenance,
and customer service needs faster escalation channels.

2. Documentation Gaps
Many issues resolved on-ground are not documented.
Recommendation: Introduce a “Quick Incident Log” mobile tool.

3. Training Improvements
New hires benefit from shadowing experienced station controllers
for at least 2 weeks before handling peak hours.

4. Passenger Flow Management
Peak-hour crowd control works better when floor markings and
queue barriers are updated every quarter.

5. Maintenance Scheduling
Night maintenance windows are sometimes too short for full-track checks.
Recommendation: Increase buffer time on Sundays.

6. Technology Use
OCC dashboard improvements could reduce manual reporting by 20–25%.

These insights are gathered from staff debriefs, exit interviews,
and monthly review meetings.
